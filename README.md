# TypeScript Task Manager

This is a simple task management application built with TypeScript. The application is designed to manage tasks effectively, allowing users to create, update, delete, and sort tasks with ease.

## **Features**

### **1. Task Management**

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a description, status, and optional priority.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks by their unique ID.
- **Update Task Description**: Modify the description of any existing task.
- **Mark Tasks**: Change a taskâ€™s status to `Completed` or `Not Completed`.

### **2. Task Sorting and Filtering**

- **Filter Completed Tasks**: Display tasks marked as `Completed`.
- **Filter Incomplete Tasks**: Display tasks marked as `Not Completed`.
- **Sort by Priority**: Arrange tasks in order of importance (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).

### **3. Date-Based Functionality**

- **Filter Tasks by Date Range**: Display tasks created within a specific date range.

### **4. Persistent Storage**

- **Save Tasks**: Serialize tasks into JSON for saving locally.
- **Load Tasks**: Load tasks from a JSON file or string.
